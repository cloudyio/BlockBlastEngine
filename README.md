# Grid Blast
Heavily inspired by Block Blast.

## How to Play
You are given a hand of 3 random pieces and an 8x8 grid. Pieces can be placed on the grid as long as they fit and don't overlap any other pieces.

- If a row or column is filled, it will be cleared to make space for new blocks and give points.
- If 2 or more rows/columns are fully filled when 1 block is placed, you will get more points for that move.
- If rows and columns are filled one after the other, a combo is unlocked to grant more points.
- If you reach a point where no more blocks can be placed onto the grid, the game ends and your final score is presented.
